1. AC is 24 units long, BC is 7 units long, AB is 25 units long. What is tan(BAC)? 2. What is the midline equation of the function g(x) = -9cos(pi/2 x - 6) + 8? 3. A trigonometric function intersects its midline at (3/5 pi, 8) and again at (7/5 pi, 8), what is the period of the function? 4. Graph the function y = 2 sin(-x) on the interval [ -2pi, 2pi ]. 5. f is a trigonometry function of the form f(x) = a cos(bx+c) + d The function has a maximum point at(pi,9) and a minimum point at (3/4 pi, 1). Find a formula for f(x). Given an exact expression.
