Problem4.1 : Write and graph the linear equation described by the following statement: Jenna works at a retail shop. She makes $10 per hour, plus $3 for each item she sells.
Problem Analysis: This problem comes from online, its topic is Line Slope, its difficulty level is basic, its word verbalized level can be categorized as a deep word problem. However, in comparison to Problem3.1, this problems give a hint to translate verbalized natural language toward the math model. It is the student-produced response problem.

How do you turn a shorter verbal phrase into an algebraic expression?

1. Phrases using a + sign:

A number plus 5 -> n+5

5 more than a number -> 5+n

The sum of 5 and a number -> 5+n

The total of 5 and a number -> 5+n

2. Phrases using a – sign:

A number minus 5  -> n – 5

5 less than a number -> n – 5

The difference between 5 and a number -> 5-n

The difference between a number and 5 -> n-5

3. Phrases using a multiple sign:

A number times 5     -> n*5

5 multiplied by a number   -> 5*n

The product of 5 and a number -> 5*n

4. Phrases using a divide sign:

A number divided by 5       -> n/5

5 over a number            -> 5/n

The quotient of 5 and a number -> 5/n

The ratio of a number and 5     -> n/5

How do you turn a longer verbal phrase into an algebraic expression?

1. Break it up

 Two times the sum of a and two b: 2*(a+2b)

 Plus half of b squared: +(1/2)*b^2

 Plus twice the sum of a and three b: +2*(a+3b)

 Equals m: =m

2. Translate

3. Combine: 2*(a+2b)+(1/2)b^2+2*(a+3b)=m
